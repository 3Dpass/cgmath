# lm-rs

lm-rs is generic linear algebra library for Rust. There is still much to do, unit tests to write, bugs to fix, and performance enhancements to make. Help is much appreciated, so please don't hesitate to send me a pull request.

## Todo:

- Matrix inversion
- Matrix rotation
- Euler and axial rotations
- Implement trait inheritance (dependant on rust/master)
- Make use of static functions for constants and constructors (dependant on rust/master)
- Performance improvements
- Increase unit test coverage
- Improve documentation
- Publish on Cargo Central
