# Lmath-rs

Lmath is generic linear algebra library for Rust. There is still much to do, unit tests to write, bugs to fix, and performance enhancements to make. Help is much appreciated, so please don't hesitate to send me a pull request.

## Installation

`$ cargo install lmath`

## Dependencies

[numeric-rs](https://github.com/bjz/numeric-rs/) (can be installed via `$ cargo install numeric`)

## Todo:

- ~~Matrix inversion~~
- ~~Matrix rotation~~
- ~~Angle types (degrees/radians)~~
- ~~Phase out the use of `num::cast::cast` for numeric conversions~~
- ~~Move numeric traits to separate library~~
- ~~ Move color types to separate library~~
- Operator Overloading
- Implement component-wise functions for vectors
- Euler and axial rotations
- Performance improvements
- Increase unit test coverage
- Improve documentation
- ~~Publish on Cargo Central~~
- Swizzle functions

Dependant on rust/master:

- ~~Implement trait inheritance~~
- Make use of static functions for constants and constructors
