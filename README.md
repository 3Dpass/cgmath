# om3D: A Linear Algebra Library for Rust

Here's some linear algebra I've been working on. I've translated it over from my unpublished D library that I was using to teach myself 3D mathematics.

## Todo:

- Unittests: I have full unittest coverage on my D project so the algorithms should be correct, but this is definately top on my list.
- Vector functions: abs, lerp, min, max
- Matrix Inversion: ugh
- Matrix rotation
- Euler and Axial rotations

## Disclaimer:

I'm new to Rust and a novice at linear algebra. I also haven't written any unittests yet (although I plan to soon). I've almost certainly made mistakes, so use this at your own risk!

At the time of writing (September 2012) the Rust language is still in a state of flux. There is a good chance that the code will be soon out of date.
