# OMath: a linear algebra library for Rust

OMath (Odyssey Math) is linear algebra I've been working on to help teach myself 3D mathematics.

## Todo:

- Matrix Inversion: ugh
- Matrix rotation
- Euler and Axial rotations

## Disclaimer:

I'm new to Rust and a novice at linear algebra, so I may have made mistake, and I may not have done things in the most efficient way. So use this at your own risk!
